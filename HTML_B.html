<p>An optical disc is a type of storage media that consists of a flat, round, portable disc made of metal, plastic, and lacquer that is written and read by a laser. Optical discs used inpersonal computers are 4.75 inches in diameter, and less than one-twentieth of an inch thick</p><p>Optical disks primarily store software, data, digital photos, movies, and music. Some optical disc formats are read only; it means users cannot write on the media. Others are read/write, which allow users to save on the disc just as they save on a hard disk.</p><p>Nearly every personal computer today has some type of optical disc drive installed on a drive bay. On some, you push a button to slide out a tray, insert the disc, and then push the same button to close the tray; others are slot loaded, which means you insert the disc in a narrow opening on the drive. When you insert the disc, the operating system automatically may start the program, music, or video on the disc.</p>
